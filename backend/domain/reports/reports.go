 * Package reports is the app around the reporting engine, without the engine.
 *
 * The distinction is the whole of why this package is small. Running a report,
 * exporting it, binding its parameters and mailing it on a timer are the
 * platform's — internal/platform/reporting — and they stay there: they are one
 * engine every distribution's modules declare reports against, not a rule of
 * this app. What is this app's is everything around them: which reports an
 * organisation may see at all, what a schedule has to satisfy before it is
 * stored, and who may agree to show another organisation a report.
 *
 * Those were HTTP handlers, and the sharing rules in particular were reachable
 * only by making a request with two tenants set up. They are the rules a person
 * would say out loud about this app, so they are here, in stdlib Go.
