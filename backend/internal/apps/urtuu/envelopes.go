 *
 * Two kinds and no more. A task assignment goes from a parent to one child; a
 * task update goes from a child back to the parent for one task. Everything
 * else the board does — assigning somebody, editing a note, closing a
 * completed task — is local, and deliberately: an organisation's internal
