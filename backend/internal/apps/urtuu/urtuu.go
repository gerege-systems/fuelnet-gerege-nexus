 * Package urtuu is the Өртөө app: the task board on top of the Өртөө channel.
 *
 * The split with internal/platform/urtuu is the one the proposal draws (§3).
 * The channel is infrastructure — links, signatures, queues, retries — and
 * belongs to the platform, because any module may one day need to hand work to
 * another installation and because a link an administrator established must
 * keep carrying what is in flight over it whatever apps come and go. What is
 * here is the product: a task, its life, its tree, and the screens for them.
 *
 * A tenant installs this the way it installs anything else. An installation
 * that has not is still on the channel: envelopes arrive, are verified, stored
 * and acknowledged, and sit unread in the inbox until the day this module is
 * compiled in and registers its readers — at which point the backlog is
 * processed rather than lost.

// committing to another organisation that the work will be done, and returning
// one is refusing in its name; both are answered for outside these walls. The
// installer's default rule grants `.read` to every member and `.manage` to
// managers, and `urtuu.process` matches neither pattern — so it reaches nobody
// by default and an administrator hands it to the people who actually answer
// for the work. That is the intended outcome, not an oversight.
