 * The register number — what a person quotes down a telephone.
 *
 * A UUID is perfect for a machine and useless to anybody else. What an officer
 * at a sum actually says is "our fourteenth assignment, the one from the aimag's
 * eighty-seventh", and until now there was nothing on the row that could be
 * said out loud.
 *
 * See migration 00066 for the format and for why there is no platform prefix on
 * it: the link already carries the other installation's name, given by the
 * administrator who established it, and a second human name for the same thing
 * is one that can disagree with the first.
