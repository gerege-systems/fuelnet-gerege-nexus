 *
 * Package organisation is the organisation and the people in it.
 *
 * It was called `core` until the ecosystem split made the name a liability:
 * "core" is what the platform underneath every app is called, and an app named
 * after the floor it stands on cannot be told apart from it in a catalogue,
 * a permission code or an import path. What this module actually holds is the
 * organisation, its departments and its people — so that is what it is called.
 *
 * What is left here is the half that really is an app. The other half — the
 * tenant's legal profile and the signed-in person's own preferences — moved to
 * the platform (internal/platform/tenant_profile_handlers.go), because the
 * control plane, the XYP rail and an SSO consent screen all read the
 * organisation's registered name without caring which apps the tenant has, and
 * a screen those depend on cannot be one an administrator is able to remove.
 *
 * The shape follows Odoo's, because the distinctions it draws are real:
 *
 *	res.company   → tenants + tenant_profiles   what the organisation is  (platform)
 *	res.users     → users                       who the person is, anywhere (platform)
 *	hr.employee   → memberships                 who they are *here*         (here)
 *	hr.department → departments                 how it is arranged          (here)
 *
 * The middle line is the one worth keeping straight. A language preference
 * belongs to a person and follows them between organisations; a job title does
 * not. The same person can be a director in one tenant and a clerk in another,
 * so the title lives on the membership and the language lives on the user.
 *
 * Unlike Odoo's `base`, this one can be removed. Nothing imports it and no
 * other module's foreign keys point at a department, so a deployment that has
 * no use for an internal directory — a queue kiosk, a single-purpose portal —
 * should not be made to carry one. It is installed by default and uninstalling
 * it closes the gate without dropping a row.
 *
 * What this module does not do is authorisation. Roles and permissions already
 * exist and are already good (rbac + Settings → Access control); this names the
 * people those roles are handed to.
