// It lived in domain/egov/postgres and ran `SELECT ... FROM audit_events`
// itself. Two things were wrong with that, and the second is the one a test
// caught. audit_events is the platform's table, so a module reading it directly
// depends on the platform's schema in a way no compiler sees — one that
// survives the module moving to another repository, right up until a column is
// renamed. And the domain layer may not name the SDK at all (ADR 0001,
// TestTheDomainDoesNotNameTheSDK): a rule that a store reaching for
// nexus.AuditReader breaks the moment it is written in domain/.
//
// So the port stays in the domain and the adapter lives here, in the module,
// which is the only layer allowed to know both.
