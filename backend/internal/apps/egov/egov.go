 * Package egov is this platform's front door to the Mongolian state's systems.
 *
 * The pieces existed already and were scattered: the ХУР registry lookups were
 * two handlers in the platform's own route table, sitting between the AI
 * endpoints and the integrations manager; whether eID, ДАН and ХУР were even
 * configured was knowable only from the deployment's environment; and what had
 * been looked up was in the audit log with nothing pointing at it. Between them
 * they are a product surface — "how this organisation is connected to the
 * state, and what it has asked the state" — and it had no name and no screen.
 *
 * What is here and what is deliberately not:
 *
 *	here     the registry lookups, the state of the three rails, and the
 *	         history of what this organisation looked up;
 *	platform the sign-in flows themselves (eID, ДАН, identity binding). They
 *	         run before anybody is signed in, so they cannot sit behind a gate
 *	         that asks which apps a tenant installed;
 *	platform a person's own list of linked identities and the button that
 *	         unlinks one. That is the account holder's, not their employer's,
 *	         and putting it behind an app an administrator can remove would
 *	         mean an administrator could take away somebody's ability to
 *	         detach their own national identity — see profile_handlers.go,
 *	         which has refused to be an app for the same reason since before
 *	         this module existed. This module links to it rather than owning
 *	         it;
 *	platform the low-level clients (platform/gerege, platform/eid,
 *	         platform/dan). They are infrastructure the platform itself signs
 *	         people in with; this module is their app-facing surface.
