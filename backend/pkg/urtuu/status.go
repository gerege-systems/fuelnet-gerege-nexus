// written into a CHECK constraint, read by a report engine and matched by a
// Prometheus label. The Mongolian name each one is presented under is in the
// comment beside it and lives in the dictionary
// (frontend/lib/i18n/addons/urtuu.ts), which is where the other six languages
// are as well. A status value is an identifier, not a label.

// documents app of the organisation that filed it, under that organisation's
// retention and access policy, and what crosses the link is the fact that it
// exists, what it is called, and whether it has been signed. An installation
// receiving a task learns that there is a signed order behind it; it does not
// receive the order.

// an identifier the reader could look up in their own database and find
// somebody else's document under.
